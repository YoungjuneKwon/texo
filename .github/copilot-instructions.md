# Repository Instructions

When working in this repository, follow this release workflow before any push:

1. Run the playground production build first:
   - `npm run build --workspace @texo-ui/playground`
2. Verify build success and fix any errors before continuing.
3. Create a commit that includes the intended changes.
4. Push only after the build and commit steps are completed.

Do not skip the playground build step before pushing.
